v0.5.4
------

Upgraded dependencies (tree-kit).


v0.5.2
------

Tests and documentation about ExecContext.getJobsStatus().


v0.5.1
------

Compatibility-breaking changes:
	* 'progress' event: the object properties' name have changed:
		- 'done' has been replaced by 'resolved' (less ambiguous, since abort, timeout & failure was counted in)
		- 'running' has been replaced by 'pending' (less ambiguous, since the job may have stopped working someway)
		- 'queued' has been replaced by 'waiting' (more appropriated)
New features:
	* 'progress' event properties: resolved, ok, failed, pending, waiting
	* ExecContext.getJobsStatus(): give insightful real-time information about the status of each jobs,
		for flow-control debugging purpose
